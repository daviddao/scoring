# Scoring mechanisms for deep funding

This repository contains sample implementations for the deep funding mechanism. There are two versions:

1. A "single-layer" mechanism, where jurors (and AI model providers) are asked to compare many items that all contributed to one single outcome.
2. A "two-layer" (really, three-layer) mechanism, where you are asked to compare dependencies of an outcome, and also dependencies of each dependency.

The example.py and example2.py scripts provide examples walking you through each approach.
